# 🌀 Day 5 - Python Loops

## 📘 Concepts Practised

- 🔁 Using the `for` loop with Python Lists  
- 🔢 `for` loops and the `range()` function

---

## 🧠 Summary

On Day 5, we explored how loops work in Python, especially the `for` loop. This allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times, which is very helpful for tasks like iterating over a list or performing actions a fixed number of times using `range()`.
